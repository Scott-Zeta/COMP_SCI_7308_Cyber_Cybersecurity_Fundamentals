## Q3
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is a "digest" that is unique to the unique values of the input. The purpose of a hash function is to take an input, and produce an output that is difficult to reverse, or invert, back to the original input.

check a file's sha256
```
sha256sum file_name
```
