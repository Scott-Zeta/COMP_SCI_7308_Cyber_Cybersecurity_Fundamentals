## ASN?
An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a unique identifier assigned to a group of IP networks that operate together under a single administrative domain. ASNs are used to facilitate routing on the Internet, allowing routers to exchange information about the networks they are connected to and determine the best path for traffic to take.

Each ASN is assigned by a regional Internet registry (RIR) such as ARIN, RIPE, or APNIC, and is typically associated with an organization or Internet service provider (ISP) that operates a network infrastructure. ASNs can range in size from a small ISP with just a few networks to a large content provider with a global network spanning multiple continents.

ASNs are commonly used in the context of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is the primary protocol used to exchange routing information between Internet routers. By exchanging information about the networks they are connected to and the paths between them, routers can build a map of the Internet and determine the most efficient routes for traffic to take.

ASN can provide info for router path finding, they are an important part of the Internet infrastructure that enables routers to learn about and communicate with other networks, identify the networks that the routers are connected to.
